Right now functionality is limited for pet objects.
The syntax is: "order <pet> "do" <something>
"do" can equal "go" (as in go north) or "kill"
(as in kill <something>).
Also one can "order pet <cardinal direction> and
the pet will try to move in the direction specified.
Note that if the <something>  or <cardinal direction>
is not present an error message will be displyed.
