Updated

Note: I REALLY need to put this code into the object files instaed of changing
the Dead Souls lib files.

12-12-14
diffs are for DeadSouls 3.8.6 mudlib

-base_trainer.c   dsx.x.x/lib/lib
DO NOT NEED TO REPLACE - is inherited from /diku-alfa/etc directory for guildmaster NPC's
Added variables in eventTrain() function under if(verb == "teach") to 
allow only spells from the trainers spellbook can be taught. Otherwise,
due to searching the spells directory "object ob = SPELLS_D->GetSpell(skill);",
all spells from every class would be able to be taught to a player.
Great for classless MUDS. Also added output if the player already
knows the spell -"if(playerspells[skill]){
                      me->eventForce("say You already know that spell.");
                      return 1;  
                  }

-bonus.c dsx.x.x/lib/lib
Modified a bug so that the bonus object is removed from the player
after the Duration counter times out. Hopefully this fix will
be added in future Dead Souls releases. Added function so that
resistances to attacks can be added using the SetResistance
function. See /lib/lib/body.c and /lib/lib genetics.c
files for info using SetResistance()

-combat.c         dsx.x.x/lib/lib
Added code to modify player morality based on kills
Also added a function to check for the 'sanctuary' effect
conferred by /domains/diku-alfa/room/40.zon/meals/4050_purple_potion.c
This object adds the property 'sanctuary' to the player with a time 
limit. The effect is to reduce damage received by half.

-genetics.c       dsx.x.x/lib/lib
Added a routine for certain npc's to cast "curse" on players
during combat. Also see diku-alfa/etc/curse.c and magic_user.c
for more info. 11-26-14 added SetBlind() function. Added a counter
to count down the 'sanctuary' effect, as described above, in
static void heart_beat()

-lead.c           dsx.x.x/lib/lib
Added some lines to allow for the "pet" routine whereby the pet 
will still be able to follow the player without evasion even if
the player moves to a different area.

-light.c          dsx.x.x/lib/secure/sefun
Added some code to emulate Diku style blindness
11-26-14 removed unnessary checks

-meal.c dsx.x.x/lib/lib
Added functionality that was present in the eventEat() function that was
not present in the eventDrink() function. The function added is evaluation 
of the function defined in SetMealAction(f). This way the called function
is evaluated when eventDrink() calls for it. Hopefully this will be
added in future Dead Souls releases.

-npc.c            dsx.x.x/lib/lib
Added code to allow for "AddActionsMap" ing capability for
NPC's. See diku-alfa/room/41.zon/npc/4103_thief.c for an example.

-potion.c         dsx.x.x/lib/lib
Added SetResistance() code as described above for bonus.c

-trainer.c        dsx.x.x/lib/lib
DO NOT NEED TO REPLACE - is inherited from /diku-alfa/etc directory by guildmaster NPC's
Modifed to inherit base_trainer.c.

-vendor_types.h   dsx.x.x/lib/include
DO NOT NEED TO REPLACE - is inherited from /diku-alfa/etc directory
Cheated and added a "boat" type object to the header file.
In order to acces the river in Midgaard the room function
checks for a "boat" type object in the characters inventory
to allow access to the room. It is not a "real" boat as pertains
to the Dead Souls mudlib.
