Placement and description of Modified Base Files

20-05-17
Updated

diffs are for DeadSouls 3.9 mudlib

FILES THAT DO NOT NEED TO BE PLACED IN THE LIB 

-base_trainer.c   dsx.x.x/lib/lib
DO NOT NEED TO REPLACE - is inherited from /diku-alfa/etc directory for guildmaster NPC's
Added variables in eventTrain() function under if(verb == "teach") to 
allow only spells from the trainers spellbook can be taught. Otherwise,
due to searching the spells directory "object ob = SPELLS_D->GetSpell(skill);",
all spells from every class would be able to be taught to a player.
Great for classless MUDS. Also added output if the player already
knows the spell -"if(playerspells[skill]){
                      me->eventForce("say You already know that spell.");
                      return 1;  
                  }
-trainer.c        dsx.x.x/lib/lib
DO NOT NEED TO REPLACE - is inherited from /diku-alfa/etc directory by guildmaster NPC's
Modifed to inherit base_trainer.c.

-vendor_types.h   dsx.x.x/lib/include
DO NOT NEED TO REPLACE - is inherited from /diku-alfa/etc directory
Cheated and added a "boat" type object to the header file.
In order to acces the river in Midgaard the room function
checks for a "boat" type object in the characters inventory
to allow access to the room. It is not a "real" boat as pertains
to the Dead Souls mudlib.


FILES TO BE PLACED IN THE LIB IN THEIR RESPECTIVE DIRECTORIES

-bonus.c dsx.x.x/lib/lib
Modified a bug so that the bonus object is removed from the player
after the Duration counter times out. Hopefully this fix will
be added in future Dead Souls releases. Added function so that
resistances to attacks can be added using the SetResistance
function. See /lib/lib/body.c and /lib/lib genetics.c
files for info using SetResistance()

-combat.c         dsx.x.x/lib/lib
Added code to modify player morality based on kills

-genetics.c       dsx.x.x/lib/lib
Added SetBlind() function and code to count down the 
effects of the curse spell from /etc/magic_user.c

-lead.c           dsx.x.x/lib/lib
Added some lines to allow for the "pet" routine whereby the pet 
will still be able to follow the player without evasion even if
the player moves to a different area.

-light.c          dsx.x.x/lib/secure/sefun
Added line to let player know if they had been blinded

-meal.c dsx.x.x/lib/lib
Added functionality that was present in the eventEat() function that was
not present in the eventDrink() function. The function added is evaluation 
of the function defined in SetMealAction(f). This way the called function
is evaluated when eventDrink() calls for it. Hopefully this will be
added in future Dead Souls releases.

-npc.c            dsx.x.x/lib/lib
Added code to allow for "AddActionsMap" ing capability for
NPC's. See diku-alfa/room/41.zon/npc/4103_thief.c for an example.

-potion.c         dsx.x.x/lib/lib
Added SetResistance() code as described above for bonus.c
