Changed 3043.c so letters on the wall can be "looked at" and "read"

Changed ticktock help output by adding the lines: "Diku->Dead
Mudlib: ticktock 1200 = 1 hr in Mudtime"

Started editing files with SetRead function so that when "look" 
sign or letters, etc, the function (:Readsign:) is not in the 
SetItems mapping. Instead the actual wording of the text "looked"
at will return the text. If the SetRead() function is in the 
SetItems mapping a "phantom" 1 will be returned at the bottom
of the text that was "looked" at instead of "read". Completed
Rooms with SetRead() function:
3003.c, 3007.c, 3008.c, 3009.c, 3010.c, 3011.c, 3020.c, 3031.c,
3034.c, 3035.c, 3034.c, 3110.c, 3111.c, 3118.c, 3120.c, 3129.c
3301.c
COMPLETED!

Replaced correct magic_user.c file in etc folder
- Reformmated contents
- Added comments for documentation
- Note: if a player is 'cursed' and uses the 'stats' command 
  changes in stats due to the curse will be noticable since 
  the stats command uses the GetStatLevel() function. Affected
  skills will NOT be noticed because the 'skills' command lists
  the players max skill regardless of skill ability changes. A 
  creator will be able to see the skill ability change by using
  the GetSkillLevel("skill") function. May need to change the
  skills.c command to reflect this.
- Need to change the function used to determine if an appropriate
  target for the magic_user is available. The current check is not
  as efficient as it should be:
    
    if(ob && (!ob->GetInCombat() || !ob->GetCurrentEnemy())) return 0;

    targets = filter(get_livings(env), (: !$1->GetInCombat() && !$1->GetSleeping() :));
    tell_room(env, "\nsizeof(targets) is "+sizeof(targets)+"\n", ({ ob }));
    if( sizeof(targets) < 1 ){
        tell_room(env, "\nNO TARGETS\n", ({ ob}));
    }
    
- Need to add functions for elevating the "magic defense" skill if
  a player is able to resist the magic spell during combat.
