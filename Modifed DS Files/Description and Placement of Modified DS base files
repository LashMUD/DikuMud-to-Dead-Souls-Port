Placement and description of Modified Base Files

11-24-14
Note: I REALLY need to put this code into the object files instaed of changing
the Dead Souls lib files.

-base_armor.c     dsx.x.x/lib/lib/std
REMOVED - not really relevant
Added line to describe armor condition when "looked at"

-base_trainer.c   dsx.x.x/lib/lib
DO NOT NEED TO REPLACE - is inherited from /diku-alfa/etc directory for guildmaster NPC's
Added variables in eventTrain() function under if(verb == "teach") to 
allow only spells from the trainers spellbook can be taught. Otherwise,
due to searching the spells directory "object ob = SPELLS_D->GetSpell(skill);",
all spells from every class would be able to be taught to a player.
Great for classless MUDS. Also added output if the player already
knows the spell -"if(playerspells[skill]){
                      me->eventForce("say You already know that spell.");
                      return 1;  
                  }

-combat.c         dsx.x.x/lib/lib
Added code to modify player morality based on kills

-config.h         dsx.x.x/lib/secure/include
REMOVED Not relevant. Recoded mayor for 20 hr day
Simply change the default Mud time of 20 hrs/per day to 24 hours/day
in config.h. Used by the Mayor for his wander routine. Change the times for 
the wander routine in diku-alfa/room/31.zon/npc/3143_mayor.c
to reflect the time for your Mud

-genetics.c       dsx.x.x/lib/lib
Added a routine for certain npc's to cast "curse" on players
during combat. Also see diku-alfa/etc/curse.c and magic_user.c
for more info
11-26-14 added SetBlind() function

-lead.c           dsx.x.x/lib/lib
Added some lines to allow for the "pet" routine whereby the pet 
will still be able to follow the player without evasion even if
the player moves to a different area.


-light.c          dsx.x.x/lib/secure/sefun
Added some code to emulate Diku style blindness
11-26-14 removed unnessary checks

-npc.c            dsx.x.x/lib/lib
Added code to allow for "AddActionsMap" ing capability for
NPC's. See diku-alfa/room/41.zon/npc/4103_thief.c for an example.

-trainer.c        dsx.x.x/lib/lib
DO NOT NEED TO REPLACE - is inherited from /diku-alfa/etc directory by guildmaster NPC's
Modifed to inherit base_trainer.c.

-vendor_types.h   dsx.x.x/lib/include
DO NOT NEED TO REPLACE - is inherited from /diku-alfa/etc directory
Cheated and added a "boat" type object to the header file.
In order to acces the river in Midgaard the room function
checks for a "boat" type object in the characters inventory
to allow access to the room. It is not a "real" boat as pertains
to the Dead Souls mudlib.
